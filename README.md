# JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome to JavaScript! This lesson involves working with a command line, and a text editor of your choice.

To start working with this lesson 
  * `fork` this repository
  * `clone` it in your local development environment
  * Once you've cloned it, `cd` into the local repository
  * And run `open index.html` from your command line
  
The rest of the instructions are in the comments in `lesson.js`. 
The second part of this lesson is the test, found in `test.js`, only attempt this once you have completed `lesson.js`.

And that's it! I hope this lesson helps you with building a strong JavaScript foundation!
